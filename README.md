# MyPy Stubs for VPython

This is a MyPy stub file for VPython, to use with MyPy and other IDEs that
use '.pyi' files to determine Typing compliance.

For Visual Studio Code awareness add this line to your `settings.json` file:
`"python.analysis.stubPath": "<path to this repo>>/vpython/stubs",`

Note: It is not complete. I only implemented the areas I'm using in VPython.
      The vector class is complete as far as I know though.
      
Note 2: If there are additional additions to this that are desired, let me know.
